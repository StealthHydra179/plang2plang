 To convert programming languages between different coding languages through JS in the browser.

## So what is the current state of the project?
The project is currently in its preliminary stages and not much has been done. Please help contribute, although the current contributing.md is not complete.

## How can I help?
The goals are listed in the project board of this repository.

## Why is Python -> JavaScript being done first?
This is because we find that a lot of people don't know JS but knoy Py.

## Why is it coded in JS
JS is decently efficient, harder to make mistakes with tabbing then PY, and JS is more object oriented.
